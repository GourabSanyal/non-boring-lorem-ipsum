1. Count - Set a state value to count the number of paragraphs you want to call
2. Text - A state value to manpulate the texts in data.js
3. handleSubmit - To handle the sumbit event (e) everytime certain number of paragraphs are called
4. As a return make a heading, make a label called "paragraph".
5. Make a <form/> and isnide it pass an <input/> whcich will handle the "onChange" and pass (e) in it
        
         <input type="number" name='amount' id='amount' vslue = {count}
            onChange = {(e) => setCount(e.target.value)}
            />
            <button type='submit' className='btn'>Generate</button>

6. eventually we will change the value for the array "text" when we invoke the function "handleSubmit"
7. As we generate that text, we will cahnge the useState(), and add some paragraphs to the "text" array
8. We will call the arrat from data.js as "text", and pass it in "handleSubmit"
